- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizations showcasing revenue growth and sales performance over time, with monthly and yearly comparisons.
- **Top Products and Categories:** Highlighting the best-performing products and categories for each company.

**Skills & Techniques Applied:**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used to create custom calculated columns and measures for total revenue, year-over-year growth, and other business metrics.
- **Power Query:** Data transformation techniques applied to clean, reshape, and merge datasets from multiple sources.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Applied to tables and charts for highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales targets and revenue thresholds.

- **Data Visualization:** Utilized a wide range of PowerBI visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps to effectively display sales and revenue data.
- **Advanced Filters & Slicers:** Incorporated advanced slicers and visual interactions to allow for detailed exploration of data across different categories and time periods.
